# Ermahgerd Nerd Blergs!

Dev teams should communicate more. Often, what we need to say should not be exposed to the client, or to the public. For that reason, I'm building `ermahgerd` as a private blogging engine for development teams.

## Goals:

* Low Maintanence: Easy to setup and configure
* Good UX: Looks good and behaves as expected.
* Universal Design: Provides prompts for writing when necessary.

## Requirements:

* Heroku
* Postgres

## License:
